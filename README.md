## Phillips Curve: An Indian Economy Analysis (1991-2024)
This Project provides an in-depth analysis of the 'Phillips Curve' in the context of the Indian economy, focusing on the period from the economic reforms of 1991 up to 2024. The Phillips Curve describes the relationship between inflation and unemployment, a cornerstone concept in macroeconomics. By investigating this relationship over three decades of transformative change in India, this project aims to reveal important trends, regime changes, and policy implications.
## Objectives
* Empirical analysis of the relationship between Inflation and Unemployment in India from 1991–2024.
* Compare different time periods (e.g. pre- and post-2008 global crisis, pre- and post-pandemic) to observe shifts and shape of the Phillips Curve.
* Identify non-linearities or changes in slope (flattening/steepening) and potential causes.
* Discuss the policy relevance of the Phillips Curve for India’s central bank and government.
## Data Collection & Preprocessing
